                    <p style="color:white;">I love this movie for a number of reasons.  More than any movie on my list, this movie made you BELIEVE. Believe in the power of
                        science and what was actually possible if someone was rich enough and God forbid, crazy enough to make it happen.
                    </p>

                    <p style="color:white;">This movie follows the exploits of a team of paleontologists, Dr. Alan Grant and Dr. Ellie Sadler. The are coerced to take a vacation 
                        on the coast of Costa Rica to see something "truly extraordinary".  The wonder, oohs and awes are overwhelming as people take
                        their first gander at what looks like realistic dinosaurs. But anytime wild beasts, especially 65 million year old extinct ones are
                        taken for granted, all hell busts loose. The movie truly is fantastic in its scope, effects and sheer wonderment.
                    </p>

                    <p style="color:white;">This movie stars Sir Richard Attenborough, Sam Neill, Laura Dern, Jeff Goldblum and Samuel L. Jackson.  This movie became one of the 
                        biggest grossing movies in history at the time it was released.
