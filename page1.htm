                    <p>I love this movie for a number of reasons.  Even though I love the first movie, the way this movie moved and retold the story. This is one of two sequels I have in my list because both of these
                        sophmore efforts surpassed the original offerings which were phenomenal in their own right.
                    </p>

                    <p>This movie follows the life of Michael Corleone, the favorite son of Don Vito Corleone and how his life changes from optimistic business man to ruthless, cruel and solitaire
                        crime boss, The Godfather.  It also chronicles the origin tale of a young Don Vito and how his name was established as a neighborhood hero and one who could be depended upon
                        to take care of his family and his community. The movie truly is fantastic in its scope, portrayal and pacing.
                    </p>

                    <p>This movie stars Al Pacino, John Cazale and Robert DeNiro, who for the first time ever, garnered an Oscar for the same character played by another person (Marlon Brando) in the previous movie, 
                        who also won an Oscar for his portrayal.
