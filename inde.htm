<h1>Rekkai's Film File</h1>
<p>Iâ€™ve been an extreme film buff since I was a child. My father had an affinity for Betamax. I started 
    the same way. But then it grew to VHS. And eventually DVD. And then Blu-ray.
     I loved watching all of the movies I could and being transported away into an engrossing story. 
     But I evolved to the point where not only do I collect them, but now I want to be in them. 
     In front of the camera, behind the camera and even write them.</p>
