# FilmLife
my project about who else? ME! And my love of Film!

I wanted to do a project that shows not only my love
of all forms of entertainment, mainly TV and movies,
but that shows my work in them and my future plans
to CREATE THEM! Hope you enjoy!

So in the nightmare that has been my life lately,
I lost my ENTIRE project and was forced to start
over this week mostly from memory, I have a HIGH number
of commits because I feel like I JUST NOW got GitHub figured
out. Go Figure!

Starting over has really been a blessing. I was stressed beyond
belief and felt I could finish. And then didn't and was reduced to
a crumpled heap.  But in taking it slow and rebuilding, minus the
strong ambition, this is going better. Not as flashy but valiant.

One of my media queries is I am using a responsive flexbox design 
to make sure my page is mobile ready and desktop ready.
