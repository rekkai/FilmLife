# FilmLife
my project about who else? ME! And my love of Film!

I wanted to do a project that shows not only my love
of all forms of entertainment, mainly TV and movies,
but that shows my work in them and my future plans
to CREATE THEM! Hope you enjoy!

As I lost my ENTIRE project and was forced to start
over this week mostly from memory, I have a HIGH number
of commits because I feel like I JUST NOW got GitHub figured
out. Go Figure!

One of my JavaScript features is the gradient background. I
just wanted to something visually appealing.
