                    <p style="color:white;">I love this movie for a number of reasons.  I don't get into foreign films as much as I like because sometimes I just want to
                        cut my brain off and enjoy some popcorn and a flick.  This move was different. I didn't mind reading the movie in Portuguese. 
                        This movie is a gripping tale told right.
                    </p>

                    <p style="color:white;">This movie follows the life of Rocket, a burgeoning photographer.  He is inadvertently thrown into the middle of conflict between
                        opposing gangs in the favelas of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.  This tale is told on several fronts and each one of them are more
                        compelling than the last. The movie truly is fantastic in its scope, portrayal and pacing.
                    </p>

                    <p style="color:white;">This movie stars a young Alice Braga and almost a completely unknown cast, many of whom were from the very neighborhoods in which 
                        the movie was shot.  This movie cleaned up at awards time and received several awards and was nominated for four Oscars.
