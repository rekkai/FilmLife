                    <p>I love this movie for a number of reasons.  Not even for what this movie meant to me but to an entire community.  The world over
                        rejoiced at the sight of a proud King, warrior, Avenger, BLACK MAN.  This movie meant so much to little boys and girls that saw
                        nothing but black excellence on the screen and it inspired an mutiple generations.
                    </p>

                    <p>This movie follows the life of T'challa. New King of the fictional country of Wakanda as he tries to figure out how to be not only
                        the best him but the man and king that his country needs all while trying to figure out how to the superhero that his country, the 
                        Avengers and the world during the middle of familial problems from the past.
                    </p>

                    <p>This movie stars Chadwick Bozeman, Angela Bassett, Michael B. Jordan, Forrest Whitaker, Sterling K. Brown and Lupita N'Yongo, who all gave fantastic 
                        portrayals but years later we are left in awe of the physicality shown by Chadwick Bozeman, who at the time was dieing of Stage 4 pancreatic cancer.
