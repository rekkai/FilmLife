        <p style="color:white;">I have been a writer since middle school.  In high school, I was hired by Disney to be a writer and like an idiot, I did not take the position because I was convinced I was an athlete.  I wasn't 
        aware that I could be more than one thing. I was dead set on being a college athlete, of which I was successful, but it was after a stint in the U.S. Army and a tour of the middle east.  I only
        wrote poems and journaled at this time.  I spent time imagining writing textbooks and tomes to improve schools and systems before I ventured in to writing novels and short stories.  
        I eventually made my way to plays and scripts and search my calendar for more time to read and more time to write.</p>
