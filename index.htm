	   <section class="intro">
      <h1>I love EVERYTHING about film!</h1>
      <p>Iâ€™ve been an extreme film buff since I was a child. My father had an affinity for Betamax.
         We loved watching all of the movies we could and being transported away into an engrossing story. 
         But I evolved to the point where not only do I collect them, but now I want to be in them. 
         In front of the camera, behind the camera and even write them.</p>
      <p>I have divided this page into several sections, which include My Favorite Films, Experience as a Filmmaker and Passion for Writing.</p>
    </section>
    <section class="featured">
      <h3>My Favorite Films</h3>
      <p>In order to stay informed about the latest movies, I utilize one of my favorite websites <a href="https://www.imdb.com/" target="_blank">The Internet Movie Database</a> to fill in all of the blanks in my memory.</p>
      <blockquote>IMDB <strong>contains all of the imformation about past, present and future movies and TV shows.</strong></blockquote>
      <p>My collection at one point was <B>EXTENSIVE!</B> How extensive? I owned over 7,000 movies in VHS, DVD and Blu-ray format.  I was an avid collector
         and that gave me a chance to develop a true sense of what I liked and the type of filmmaker I would be one day.  To the side are 10 of my favorite films but
         it is due to what they meant to me, as opposed to if I think they are the best movies of all time.</p>
      <h3>Experience As A Filmmaker</h2>
      <p>I have had alot of different experiences with film. I have had the pleasure of working as an actor in a few films and TV shows, including <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxcn3LJOXD0" target="_blank">SMOKETOWN</a>
      , (notably episodes 5 and 6), which was shot here in Louisville. I have a long career of acting in plays for the stage, but my passion is creating them.  I have written, directed, produced, acted and edited several plays
      over the last 7 years.  My desire is to create short films and enter film festivals.</p>
      <h3>Passion For Writing</h3>
      <p>I have been a writer since middle school.  In high school, I was hired by Disney to be a writer and like an idiot, I did not take the position because I was convinced I was an athlete.  I wasn't 
      aware that I could be more than one thing. I was dead set on being a college athlete, of which I was successful, but it was after a stint in the U.S. Army and a tour of the middle east.  I only
      wrote poems and journaled at this time.  I spent time imagining writing textbooks and tomes to improve schools and systems before I ventured in to writing novels and short stories.  
      I eventually made my way to plays and scripts and search my calendar for more time to read and more time to write.</p>
